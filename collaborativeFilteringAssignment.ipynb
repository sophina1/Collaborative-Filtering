    "# matrices. One advantage is that it captures latent factors, meaning it identifies hidden patterns in user preferences that are not\n",
    "# explicitly stated. Another advantage is that it handles sparsity, because real-world datasets are sparse (most users rate only a small\n",

    "# reduces dimensionality by compressing large datasets, and it avoids overfitting by learning meaningful representations of user preferences\n",
